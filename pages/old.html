    <h4>What is a hackathon?</h4>
    <p>Major League Hacking &copy defines a hackthon as an “invention marathon”.
      Anyone who has an interest in technology attend a hackathon to learn,
      build and share their creations over the course of a weekend in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere.
      You don’t have to be a programmer and you certainly don’t have to be majoring in Computer Science.</p>

    <h4>What if I'm a new?</h4>
    <p>HackISU has great opportunities for people that are new to programming.
      In fact, we encourage new programmers to come because hackathons provide an opportunity to gain experience.
      As a new programmer at HackISU, you will learn a lot in a short
      amount of time, be challenged, and build something awesome.</p>
