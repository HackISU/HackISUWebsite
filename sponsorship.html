                    <p>HackISU is a 36 hour programming competition focused on the technology and computer/software industries. 
                        Over 450 students come to HackISU to learn and build amazing projects for an entire weekend. The event
                        is free, and inclusive to students of all programming abilities.</p>

                    <h5 class="pt-3">What if I'm interested in sponsoring?</h5>
                    <p>That is fantastic! We can't wait to work with you! Please send us an email to <a href="mailto:hackiowastate@gmail.com" class="fontBorder fontBorderLink">hackiowastate@gmail.com</a>.
                        We will follow-up with you to showcase our variety of sponsor packages.</p>

                    <h5 class="pt-3">Why do we need sponsors?</h5>
                    <p>HackISU is <strong>100%</strong> funded by sponsors. Our sponsors help us to provide meals for hundreds of students during the event, 
                        as well as buying swag/prizes for the best hacks. They also allow organizers to travel to leadership conventions, like MLH Hackcon. 
                        Sponsors can help students learn by giving tech talks during the event, and also participate as mentors for hackers.</p>

                    <h5 class="pt-3">What are the benefits of having a booth?</h5>
                    <p>Sponsors having a booth at HackISU means that our hackers will see that you’re there! They’ll know where you 
                        are and will be able to ask you any questions they may have during the hackathon. The booth will also serve as 
                        your home-base during the event for any recruiters/mentors participating. This is important for you to 
                        get the most out of your sponsorship!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-4">
                    <h5 class="pt-3">How long should we be at the booth?</h5>
                    <p>There’s no set schedule for when recruiters or mentors have to be at their booth. We depend on our sponsors 
                        having a representative from the company at their designated booth when the event begins on Friday 
                        evening as well as throughout the event. Having a presence on Friday evening is important because that is 
                        when students are arriving and not yet hacking, so they will have time to talk with you about your company, any prizes 
                        you’re offering, and ask you about job/internship opportunities. They are also starting to form their project 
                        ideas -- they’ll want to talk with you about how to win your prize!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-4">
                    <h5 class="pt-3">If I don't have a booth, how do I distribute recruiting materials?</h5>
                    <p>We will have a general swag table where we will put any swag/recruiting materials you’d like to give us.</p>

                    <h5 class="pt-3">What do mentors do?</h5>
                    <p>Mentors are the lifeline for our hackers. Most people are working with topics or tools that they’ve never touched 
                        before and are just learning, so mentors can help with hacker question or aid in a strategy to fix the issue. 
                        Mentors are your most direct interaction with our hackers. It is a great opportunities to talk about your sponsor prize, 
                        event, or API. We’ve heard countless stories of people getting help right as they’re about to quit, and are then 
                        helped by a timely mentor who makes a real positive impression in the hacker’s weekend. Those are the 
                        moments that help make HackISU a valuable and memorable experience!</p>

                    <h5 class="pt-3">How many mentors can I send?</h5>
                    <p>We’re happy to have as many mentors as you’d like to bring along. The more the merrier. It’s great to have a 
                        variety of mentors with skillsets in everything from embedded systems to mobile to web development.</p>

                    <h5 class="pt-3">Do mentors have to stay the whole time?</h5>
                    <p>Mentors can spend as much or as little time as they’d like at the event, but prime time for mentors is Friday from 8pm 
                        - Midnight as people are exploring their project ideas and Saturday from 10am - Midnight as hackers are starting to
                        get into the gritty details of their projects. If you need a brief of a break from the hustle and bustle of mentoring, 
                        please feel free to take advantage of our Sponsor Lounge!</p>

                    <p>Events at HackISU are fun ways for hackers to take a break from staring at their project and enjoy a 
                        lighthearted game or activity. Examples of fun events are cup stacking, handing out caffeinated goodies, 
                        technical challenges or brain teasers, and any kind of career help. This is a great opportunity to access 
                        hackers in a situation where they’re not preoccupied with the bug they’re trying to fix.</p>

                    <h5 class="pt-3">What is a lightning talk?</h5>
                    <p>Lightning talks are short (~15 minutes), technical presentations geared to provide hackers with an intro 
                        into a useful tool, framework or API. These are a great way to take some tool you love to use, and give 
                        students some information about how they can use it for their hacks. Lightning talks are also great 
                        places to show of your API and create some buzz around your company prize.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-4">
                    <h5 class="pt-3">What is a tech talk?</h5>
                    <p>Tech talks are mid-length (~30 minutes) presentation that are best used to go over some programming 
                        concept, API, or tool. Talking about open source contribution, how to build usable libraries, or some 
                        quick ways to dabble in machine learning are some examples of tech talk topics. The longer time allows 
                        for an in-depth look at whatever you’re showcasing, but it should still be something that an attendee 
                        could use at the event or explore more on their own after HackISU.</p>
